This repository contains a legacy snapshot of the drumClassifierTest.py program. 

This program uses SciKit-learn to classify one-shot drum samples into 5 categories:
kick, snare, open hat, closed hat, other.

To install the necessary libraries, run the following pip3 install command in terminal:

$ pip3 install librosa pandas scikit-learn soundfile numpy simpleaudio matplotlib tk joblib

To execute the program, navigate to the drumClassifier-legacy directory and run the following command

$ python3 drumClassifierTest.py

The program comes with a pretrained model. To classify the example dataset with the existing model, enter N. To re-train the model and view the accuracy report, enter Y.
